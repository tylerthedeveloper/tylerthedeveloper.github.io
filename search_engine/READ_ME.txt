This is the final submission for Jack Garlick, Tyler Citrin, and Tyler Mehay

We created a search engine that can be used to search for anything programming related. The URL can be found here:

We used multiprocessing to index the pages we crawled and implemented Pagerank and TFIDF. Our indexer is capable of crawling infinite amount of sites but we maxed it out at 1,500 to go easy on IU's servers since we weren't sure how much we could do. We attempted to parallelize Pagerank as well which you can see in our PagerankOriginal.py file, it became too unorganized though so we decided to focus on paralellizing the indexing portion. You can run our indexer by running the main.py file. 

Thanks for the awesome semester and we hope you like our project!
