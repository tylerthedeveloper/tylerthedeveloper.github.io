# Arrays
    
*   Immutable Object - Require pre-allocated space

*   An Indexed collection of elements (of the same type)

*   Elements include built-in or custom objects or data-types

## *When to use arrays*

*   When you know the size of the list
*   When the size of the list won't change
*   When the ordering of the list won't change
*   When dealing with matrices (n-dimensional lists)
*   When binary / linear search is needed
*   When direct (indexed) access is needed
