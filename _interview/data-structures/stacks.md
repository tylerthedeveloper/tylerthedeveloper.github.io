# Stack
* A **stack** is a *collection* data type that is best visualized as a "tower" of elements
* There are two basic operations that can be done on a stack:
   * **push()**: adds an element to the top of the stack
      * Depending on your implementation of **stack**, you may need to check if the stack is not full first
   * **pop()**: removes an element from the top of the stack if the stack is not empty
* It can be described as *LIFO* (Last in, First out)


## *When to use stacks*
* A popular assignment given to beginners is to reverse a word. This can be achieved by pushing every character to a stack, then popping the
entire stack.
* The **stack** data structure can be used to undo changes in programs like Microsoft Word. All of your edits are stored in a stack for easy 
retrieval.


## *Time complexity*
| Operation   | Time Complexity |
|--------|------|
| push   | O(1) |
