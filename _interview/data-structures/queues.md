# Queue
* A **queue** is a *collection* data type that is best visualized as a "line" of elements
* There are a two basic operations that can be done on a queue:
   * **enqueue()**: adds an element to the left of the queue if the queue is not full
   * **dequeue()**: remove the rightmost element of the queue if the queue is not empty
* The following operation is necessary if the queue is finite
   * **size()**: returns the size of the queue; useful for checking if it is full
* It can be described as *FIFO* (First in, First out)

## *Time complexity*
| Operation   | Time Complexity |
|---------|------|
| enqueue | O(1) |
| dequeue | O(1) |
| size    | O(n) |
