# Set

*   Similar concept in discrete mathemtics / set theory

*   Only contains unique items (i.e. no duplicates)

*   Uses hashing to achieve constant time look up


## *When to use sets*
*   When you need unique data   

## *Time complexity*
* Insert
	* Average: O(1)
	* Worst: O(n)
* Delete
	* Average: O(1)
	* Worst: O(n)
* Traversal: O(n)

## *Practice questions*
