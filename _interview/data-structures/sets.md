# The _Set_ Data Structure
## Overview
* Similar concept to the _sets_ from set theory (a subset of discrete mathematics).
* Only contains unique items; no duplicates allowed.
    * This rule is enforced as data is added to the list.
* Uses a _hash_ function to achieve constant lookup time

## When to Use Sets
* When you need unique data.
    * Remember, it prevents duplicates from being added.

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Average Time Complexity |
| :---: | :---: |
| Insert | O(1) |
| Delete | O(1) |
| Traversal | O(n) |
