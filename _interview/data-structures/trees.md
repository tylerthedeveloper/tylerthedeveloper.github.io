# The _Tree_ Data Structure
## Overview
* Hierarchical data structure starting with a _root_ node.
* An abstract data type; a _collection_ of nodes with values.
* Maintains pointers to children at the bare minimum.
    * Can have additional pointers, but this requires more memory.
* The _level_ of a given node is important.
* Doesn't necessarily uphold the __heap__ property.
* Can utilize both breadth-first and deapth-first searching recursively.

## Binary Trees
A _binary tree_ is a specific case in which each node in a tree has at most two children, which are referred to as the
left and right child respectively<sup>1</sup>. This type of tree is extremely common in __CSCI-C 343__ and computer science in general.

## When to use trees
* When you want to flatten, sort, or dichotomize data.
* When a node's level is important.
* When you need your data to be ordered in a hierarchy.
