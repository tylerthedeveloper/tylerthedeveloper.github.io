# Preparing for the Interview
## Before the Interview
* **Non-technical tips**:
    *   Do your research!!! You should know about the company and the role you're applying for
    *   Hone your research - find talking points, recent news events, and specific  information related to your skills and interests
    *   Feel free to bring out printed articles that interest you


* **Technical tips**:
    *   Utilize sites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) to see if anyone has advice for interviewing at the company.
    *   Get familiar with the types of technologies the company uses
    *   Get familiar with the different (technical) projects and products the company offers
    *   Get comfortable with your strongest language, most typical include C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript
    *   Review data structures, common algorithms, and syntax

## Key Tips 

* **PRACTICE CODING IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT YOU'LL BE TESTED IN.**
    * Get used to the coding environment, whether it's a Google Doc or in-person on a whiteboard.


*   **Know what technical skills and projects are on your resume** - *any information there is fair game!*
    * Order langauges / technologies in decreasing proficiency
    * Practice the STAR method when talking about your projects

# During the interview

## Key Tips
*   **If you've seen a question before,** tell your interviewer the truth and he or she will decide how to proceed


*   **Be comfortable and relaxed, have fun and rememeber your interviewer is a person too!**

**1. Clarify -** Make sure you know what is being asked! Paraphrase or rephrase the question until you and your         interviewer are on the same page. 

*   A lot of people get tripped up and end up solving a different problem.
*   ***Ask about constraints and different combinations of inputs, runtime, space, etc.***

**2. Examples -** One of the most important steps! Write tests cases / create examples.
* Try to find all edge cases satisfying the constraints (from step 1)

**3. Brute Force -** Use the _brute force approach_ for your initial solution. A solution that answers the question is better than no solution at all.

* Walk the interviewer through your approach out loud and ask if the proposed idea would be a good start
* Make sure to cover all the test cases, use your examples from step 2.
* It may seen counterintuitive to start with the brute force approach, especially if you've been asked to write code within a certain time complexity, but you can optimize your code later on.

**4. Optimization -** There are five different ways to optimize
    
4.1. Follow __BUD__ and ask yourself the following questions:  
    * __Bottlenecks__: What is the slowest part of the code? Is there a better way to accomplish this task?  
    * __Unnecessary Work__: Is the code checking for anything that doesn't need to be checked?  
    * __Duplicate Work__: Is the code calculating anything twice?  
        * If this is the case, save the value under a variable so it is only calculated once.

4.2. Use the __DIY__ approach
    * If I were a machine, how would I run this code? Can I implement that to make the code more efficient?

4.3. Simplify and generalize
    * Try to reduce the constraints then afterwards attempt to generalize your solution

4.4. Analyze the __base case__
    * Identify the base case, and build upon it.

4.5. Brainstorm [__data structures__](../C343/data-structs/data-structures-index)
    * Test a few and list drawbacks and benefits. Choosing the right data structures could be the key to completing the problem.

**5. Code the Solution** *(and use good coding practices)*

* 5.1 Syntax should be written out; don't use abbreviations.
    * Unless told otherwise, demonstrate a strong attention to detail.

* 5.2. Do not pseudo code for your solution
    * Unless told otherwise, produce an executable solution in code. 
    * Only use psuedo for quick testing during step 3 or for general planning.

* 5.3. Meaningful names for variables (you can shorthand them later)
    * This is a good opportunity to show that you are organized and creative.

**6. Test using examples from step 2 -** If you've gotten this far, make sure your interviewer is 
    on the same page as you.
* Use your examples/tests from _step 2_ and edge cases to test your code in real-time.
* It's important to let your interviewer know what you're doing, which tests you're using, and what goes wrong if the tests fail.
* Check constraints first, then come up with new ones. Ask the interviewer if they have any constraints of their own that they would like to test.

**7. Walkthrough and overview your solution -** Similar to the previous step, explain your code 
* Go from top to top to bottom and detail and explain decisions you've made along the way.
* Talk about runtime, space, and any other relevant qualities of your solution.
* Finally, ask if the interviewer is satisfied with the solution and if they have any questions.

# After the Interview
* **Non-technical tips**:
    * Thank your interview for their time and ask questions you prepared beforehand about their company and position.
    * Ask about next steps and the rest of the recruiting process.
    * Some interviewers might be willing to give feedback on how you did and give advice if you ask.
* **Technical tips**:
    * Go home and take notes! Even if the interview didn't go as well as you had hoped, it's still a great learning opportunity.
    * If you didn't successfully solve a question or did so but not to the best of your ability, try solving it on your own time.
        * This will be especially helpful if you receive a similar question in the future.
        * Solve the question on a whiteboard, Google Doc, or wherever you solved it during the interview.
