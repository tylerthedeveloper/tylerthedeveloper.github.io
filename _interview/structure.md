[return to overview](/interview)

# Before the interview
*(Non-technical)*
*   Do your research!!! You should know about the company and the role you're applying for
*   Hone your research - find talking points, recent news events, and specific information 
    related to your skills and interests

*(Technical)*
*   Look on sites like glassdoor to see if anyone has any advice for interviews at the company
*   Get familiar with the types of technologies the company uses
*   Get familiar with the different (technical) projects and products the company offers
*   Get comfortable with your strongest language, most typical include C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript
*   Review data structures, common algorithms, and syntax

## Key Tips 
*   **PRACTICE CODING IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT YOU WILL BE IN -** Whether a google doc, in person on a whiteboard, 
or just a simple online submission, get used to that coding environment 

*   **Know what technical skills and projects are on your resume - any information there is fair game**

# During the interview

## Key Tips
*   **If you've seen a question before-** tell your interviewer the truth and he or she will decide how to proceed

*   **Be comfortable and relaxed, have fun and rememeber your interviewer is a person too!**


**1. Clarify -** Make sure you know what is being asked! Paraphrase or rephrase the question until you and your         interviewer are on the same page. A lot of people get tripped up and end up solving a different problem.
    ***Ask about constraints and different combinations of inputs, runtime, space, etc.***

**2. Examples -** One of the most important steps! Write tests cases / create examples. Try to find all edge cases  satisfying the constraints (from step 1)

**3. Brute Force -** Plan your first solution. A solution that answers the question is better than no solution at all. Talk it outloud, walk through your test cases, and ask if the proposed idea would be a good start

**4. Optimization -** There are five different ways to optimize
    
    4.1. Follow "BUD"
		
        - Bottleneck: what is the slowest part of the code, is there a better way to accomplish that

	    - Unecessary work: are you checking anything that does not need to be checked
		
        - Duplicate work: are you calculating anything twice 
                (or can you calculate different things at the same time)

	2. DIY - How would do you do it in your mind or physically? Can that be put into code

	3. Simplify and Generalize - Try to reduce the constraints then 
                                afterwards attempt to generalize your solution

	4. Base case and build - Try to solve a piece of it and then build upon it

	5. Data-structure brainstorm - Test each one and list drawbacks and benefits

**5. Code solution**

    5.1. Syntax should be correct
        - Unless told otherwise, demonstrate a strong attention to detail.

	5.2. Do not pseudo code for your solution
        - Unless told otherwise, produce an executable solution in code. 
        - Only use psuedo for quick testing during step 3 or for general planning.

	5.3. Meaningful names for variables (you can shorthand them later)
        - Show that you are organized, creative

**6. Test using examples from step 2 -** If you've gotten this far, make sure your interviewer is 
    on the same page as you. Check your constraints and test those first, then come up with new ones
    and ask the interviewer if has any of his own to test.

**7. Walkthrough and overview your solution -** Similar to the previous step, explain your code 
    from top to bottom, detailing certain decisions along the way. Talk about the runtime, space, 
    and anything else that is relevant at the time. Ask if the interviewer is satisfied and 
    if he has any questions.

# After the interview
*(Non-technical)*
*   Thank your interviewer and ask questions you prepared about the company and position
*   Ask about next steps and the rest of the recruiting process
*   Some interviewers will give feedback on how you did and provide advice you ask

*(Technical)*
*   Go home and take notes! Every interview is a really good learning opportunity
*   If you didn't successfully solve a question or not to the best of your ability,
    try and solve it on your own time just in case you ever get a similar question in the future
