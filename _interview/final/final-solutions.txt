Adjacency Lists / Matrices
A) Write code to find an element in a matrix where the elements in each row and column are in a non-decreasing order

Example:
        {  2, 14, 26, 37, 43, 51, }
        {  4, 16, 28, 38, 44, 54, }
        {  6, 18, 30, 39, 45, 57, }
        {  8, 20, 32, 40, 46, 60, }
        { 10, 22, 34, 41, 47, 63, }
        { 12, 24, 36, 42, 48, 66, }

B-Tree
List Properties of B-Tree
1) All leaves are at same level.
2) A B-Tree is defined by the term minimum degree ‘t’. The value of t depends upon disk block size.
3) Every node except root must contain at least t-1 keys. Root may contain minimum 1 key.
4) All nodes (including root) may contain at most 2t – 1 keys.
5) Number of children of a node is equal to the number of keys in it plus 1.
6) All keys of a node are sorted in increasing order. The child between two keys k1 and k2 contains all keys in range from k1 and k2.
7) B-Tree grows and shrinks from root which is unlike Binary Search Tree. Binary Search Trees grow downward and also shrink from downward.
8) Like other balanced Binary Search Trees, time complexity to search, insert and delete is O(Logn)

Graph
A) Given a list of edges in a graph or "Forest," find the distinct amount of "trees" or separate nodes (e.g. other metaphors, islands in an ocean, trees in a forest, disconected components)

Input :  edges[] = {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {3, 4}
Output : 2
Explanation : There are 2 trees
                   0       3
                  / \       \

Dijkstra - Proofs

A) Does this algorithm work for negatives - why or why not?

B) Does the shortest path change when weights of all edges are multiplied by 10?

C) Given a directed weighted graph and the shortest path from vertex ‘s’ to ‘t’ => D(s,y).  
If weight of every edge is increased by 10 units, does the shortest path remain same in the modified graph?
