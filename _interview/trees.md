# (Binary) Trees

*   Hierarchical data structure starting with root

*   An abstract data type, collection of nodes with values

*   Maintain pointers to children, can have additional pointers (requiring space)

*   There is a notion of "levels"

*   Similar heap property calculations

*   Can utilize both breadth and depth first search (often recursively)


## *When to use trees*
*   To flatten, sort, and or dichotomize data
*   When you need a notion of levels
*   When there is a notion of hierarchy or ordering
