# TLDR; What is this all about?

[See me in action conducting a sample interview here!](pages/sample)  
It may seem as though I am talking to myself, but I am actually playing the role of both the interviewer and the interviewee


# Introduction
Welcome to Tyler Citrin's website for Indiana University's School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (SICE) Career Services.
This website originally supported Indiana University's Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) program for CSCI-C 343 "Data Structures and Algorithms." This site was inspired by Suzanne Menzel who was my instructor for this course.

# Breakdown
I have organized my site into a few different sections:
*   [Interview Structure along with Tips and Tricks](structure)
*   [Post archives of sessions](archives)
*   [Data-type, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Big-O TC!](materials)
*   [Information all the different types of role](roles)
*   [Great Study Resources](resources)

# Mock Interviews

In addition to the C343 PLTL program, you can schedule mock interviews through SICE Careers. These interviews can be scheduled via the
 'Appointments' tab on the [SICE Careers website](https://sice-indiana-csm.symplicity.com/students/index.php).
