# Tech Industry Roles
Listed below are a few popular jobs in the tech industry.

## Software Engineer vs. Software Developer
I try to capture the specifics below, but here is a phenomenal professionally written article that really captures the differnece between the two, and [explains what software engineers and developers do, how much they earn, what skills are needed to become a software developer, and how to hire them - check it out here!](https://www.developersforhire.com/software-developer-vs-software-engineer)

## Software Engineer
A __software engineer__ is someone who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance,
testing, and evaluation of computer software. These principles<sup>1</sup> are as follows:
1. Separation of Concerns
2. Modularity
3. Abstraction
4. Anticipation of Change
5. Generality
6. Incremental Development
7. Consistency

## Microsoft Program Manager
__Program management__ is a role coined by Microsoft that sites alongside the __Engineering Lead__ role to form a "Duo" in company terminology.
This _duo_ works toegether to ensure the team's vision receives support from the highest levels of executive leadership. Additionally, they
obtain resources to enable teams to implement their vision and achieve great success in the developmental stage.

## Product Manager
A __product manager__ communicates the vision of the product from top-level executives to the development and implementation teams.ms

## Software Developer
__Software development__ is different from __software engineering__ in that it deals with the theoretical design of the product.
Software developers work with clients to create an outline of what the latter wants<sup>2</sup>. A separate team of programmers then creates the
product.

## Data Scientist
A __data scientist__ analyzes and intreprets complex digital data, such as the usage statistics of a website. Patterns can be extracted from
this data. Data science can assist businesses in their decision-making (e.g. deciding which features to improve).

## Technical Product Manager (PM)
__Technical product managers__ bring a deep technical expertise to their role, but still focus on the core practices<sup>3</sup> of product management:
1. Understanding company goals
2. Interacting with customers
3. Utilizing the knowledge of your __sales__ and __support__ teams
4. Using (and getting familiar with) the product
5. Analyzing similar and relevant products
6. "Plan, Execute, Iterate"
7. Connect with fellow PMs to stay up-to-date

If the company is _tri-structured_, technical product managers sit between the head __Project Manager__ and the __Engineering Lead__
