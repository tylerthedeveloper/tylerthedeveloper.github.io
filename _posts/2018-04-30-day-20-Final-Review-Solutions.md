# I. Adjacency Lists / Matrices

## A) Write code to find an element in a matrix where the elements in each row and column are in a non-decreasing order
### Example:
        {  2, 14, 26, 37, 43, 51, }
        {  4, 16, 28, 38, 44, 54, }
        {  6, 18, 30, 39, 45, 57, }
        {  8, 20, 32, 40, 46, 60, }
        { 10, 22, 34, 41, 47, 63, }
        { 12, 24, 36, 42, 48, 66, }  


# II. Trie

## A) Advantages of a Trie

## B) Dis-advantages of a Trie

## C) Use cases for a Trie


# III. B-Tree

## A) List Properties of B-Tree


# IV. Graph

## A) Given a list of edges in a graph or "Forest," find the distinct amount of "trees" or separate nodes (e.g. other metaphors, islands in an ocean, trees in a forest, disconected components)
    Input :  edges[] = {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {3, 4}

    Output : 2

    Explanation : There are 2 trees
                   0       3
                  / \       \
                 1   2       4


# V. Dijkstra - Proofs

## A) Does this algorithm work for negatives - why or why not?

## B) Does the shortest path change when weights of all edges are multiplied by 10?

## C) Given a directed weighted graph and the shortest path from vertex ‘s’ to ‘t’ => D(s,y).   If weight of every edge is increased by 10 units, does the shortest path remain same in the modified graph?
